### Code overview (Testing phase)
The client has an unmaintained message- app that they would like us to bring back to life. Team4 have therefore been tasked with testing the code base in order to find and fix bugs and poorly maintained functionality. 

We are currently testing the code base with the goal of deploying it to a staging server and a working state where adding new features is possible. For the time being the following bullet points **in bold** have been tested, making sure that the user: 

* **Can create an account**
* **Can log in to their account**
* **Can receive messages**
* **Can view messages in their inbox**
* Can log out of their account
* Gets notifications for new messages
* Can view sent messages
* Can respond to messages
* Can delete message
* Has a list of contacts
* Can send messages
* Can create messages
* Can restore deleted messages

### Installments
If you'd like to try and fix the app yourself you're free to help us out. You'll need to fork this Repo and download:

* Rails
> gem install rails
* Gems
> bundle install
* Rspec
